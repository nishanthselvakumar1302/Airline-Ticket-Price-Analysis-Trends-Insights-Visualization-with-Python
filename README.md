# âœˆ Airline Ticket Pricing Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This project delivers an **end-to-end data analysis** and **interactive dashboard** for airline ticket pricing trends using **Python**.  
It combines **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **statistical testing**, and **machine learning** to uncover actionable insights in airline pricing patterns.  
A **Streamlit-based dashboard** is included for **real-time, user-driven exploration** of the data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
- Analyze pricing trends by airline, route, class, booking window, and stops.
- Identify factors affecting ticket prices.
- Build an interactive dashboard for dynamic data exploration.
- Provide business recommendations for airlines, agencies, and travelers.

## ðŸ›  Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Standardized column names and data types.
- Converted numeric and datetime columns.
- Created **route** column: `source_city â†’ destination_city`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Price distribution across airlines.
- Price variation with booking lead time (`days_left`).
- Class-wise price comparison.
- Route-level pricing patterns.
- Flight duration vs. price correlation.

### 3. Statistical Testing
- **ANOVA** to test mean price differences across airlines and classes.
- **T-tests** for Economy vs Business fares.

### 4. Machine Learning
- **Random Forest model** to predict ticket prices.
- Feature importance analysis to identify key pricing drivers.

### 5. Dashboard Development
- Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** with sidebar filters.
- KPIs and visualizations updating dynamically.
- *(Optional)* Price prediction form for custom flight details.
